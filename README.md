Weather App with CI/CD Pipeline

This project is a DevOps CI/CD demonstration that showcases the 
automation of application development, testing, and deployment. 
The application itself is a simple weather app that displays 
real-time weather information for a selected city.

ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate a fully automated 
CI/CD pipeline using modern DevOps tools and practices. 
As part of this initiative, new features will be continuously 
added to the application, and each change will trigger the pipeline for:

Automated testing

Building the application
Deploying to the environment

ðŸ›  Features

Display current weather data for a chosen city (temperature, description, etc.).
CI/CD pipeline integration to automate the build and deployment process.
Incremental feature updates to demonstrate pipeline efficiency.

ðŸš€ How It Works

Code Changes: New features or updates are committed to the repository.
Pipeline Trigger: The CI/CD pipeline automatically starts upon detecting changes.
Stages in the Pipeline:
Testing: Ensures that all code changes pass unit and integration tests.
Build: Packages the application into a container or other deployable format.
Deployment: Automatically deploys the application to a staging or production environment.
Result: The updated application is live, ready for users to explore new features.
